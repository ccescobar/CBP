# Cody's Best Practices for Homelabing
This repo is meant to hold @soarinFerret 's Homelabbing Best practices. It will be updated everytime we think of a best practice that should be done. 

1. If your server has two Power Supplies, plug both to the wall
2. Keep both cables under a battery backup 
3. If you buy a new house, make sure you have 2x220AMP wires available for your PDU's
4. Always stay protected with the latest updates and make backups.
